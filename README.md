# Customer Churn Analysis

This repository showcases the utilization of scikit-learn in constructing a machine learning model to forecast customer churn in a Telecommunications company. The project encompasses tasks such as data loading, analysis, preprocessing, feature preparation, model training, evaluation, and deployment. Predictive analytic models offer the ability to anticipate customer churn by evaluating their likelihood or susceptibility to churn. These models can produce a roster of customers who are at higher risk of churning, enabling the implementation of a targeted customer retention program focused on them.

The analysis presented in this notebook made use of the publicly accessible [IBM Sample Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn).
